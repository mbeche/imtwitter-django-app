# Twitter-Like Application with Django

This is a project assigned as the finals steps of an interview for a Python/JavaScript position. I am fairly new to Django, so this will be an interesting endeavor :)

You can check out my commit history to see the workflow of this project. Also, see the folder in the directory "IMTwitter/Progress" for blogs I wrote for each day of the process.
