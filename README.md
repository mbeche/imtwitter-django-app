# Twitter-Like Application with Django

This is a project assigned as the finals steps of an interview for a Python/JavaScript position. I am fairly new to Django, so this will be an interesting endeavor :)

The app is located in the directory "post-app". You can check out my commit history to see the workflow of this project. Also, see the folder in the directory "Progress" for blogs I wrote detailing my thoughts and process each day of the project (~1 week).
