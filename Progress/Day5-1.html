<h1>Day 5: Continuing Styling, getting close to deploy</h1>
<em>May 2, 2018 at 10:47am</em>

<p>I'm feeling good with my accomplishments on this project thus far. I want to take some time now to list out the features I've gotten functional and what I have left to work on.</p>
<h2>Specified Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Complete:<del><em>Users must create an account to add a new message</em></del></li>
  <li>Message Specifications:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete: <del><em>limit message characters to 140</em></del></li>
    <li>If a message contains a url to an image, show the image on the page instead of the URL</li>
    <li>Do not count characters that are part of a URL (for links or images)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Users can edit or delete messages they created</li>
  <li>Users can filter to list messages:
    <ul>
      <li>They have authored</li>
      <li>Other user's messages</li>
      <li>All messages from all users (normal view?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Users can search for a message</li>
  <li>Users can send private messages to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow - looking at it from this perspective I haven't really accomplished all that much from the task list! That's okay, good thing I have a few more days to work on it. I already have a leg up on editing and deleting messages. I think filtering and searching messages should be the next thing I work towards. Then I should figure out adding an app to make PMs possible between users. Here's my new sprint plan:</p>
<h3>
  <p>Breakdown of future work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 6: Make things look nicer and add links to appropriate pages</li>
    <li>Sprint 7: Allow users to delete & edit posts they have created</li>
    <li>Sprint 8: Load IMTwitter onto Digital Ocean for sharing</li>
    <li>Sprint 9: Create URL recognition in post/comment & load image if image URL is provided</li>
    <li>Sprint 10: Create views to sort posts and comments by author</li>
    <li>Sprint 11: Add search feature</li>
    <li>Sprint 12: Add capabilities of private messaging other users</li>
    <li>Sprint 13: Add advanced user function like change password/reset password</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<p>Side note: I figured out how to get the post that the commenter is posting on onto the comment page. Post was already save with the <code>get_object_or_404</code> function, I just needed to load in on the template with <code>{{ post }}</code>.</p>
<h2>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Center the "new post" and "new comment" dialogue box</li>
  <li>Add menu items that change whether you are logged in or not</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Not logged in: only "About", "Login", "Create Account"</li>
    <li>Logged in: "Create Post", "About", "Account", "Logout"</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Create about page that has more info</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>A short overview of what I've done with this project and why</li>
    <li>Access to these notes to help the IMT team look through the process I took in creating this</li>
    <li>Contact info for me</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h2>Sprint 7: Allow users to delete & edit posts they have created</h2>
<p>To help me with this I'm following help from this <a href="http://www.mastercode.online/tutorials/language/tutorial_series/tutorial/how-to-django-blog-application-how-to-edit-post-in-django/">tutorial.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create new view for editing post that takes</li>
  <li>Instruct the view to use the same <code>add_post.html</code> to edit post in </li>
  <li>use <code>post = get_object_or_404(Post, pk)</code> shortcut function again to load post and complete view</li>
  <li>Add URLconf for editing the post using a re_path to use regex</li>
  <li>Update template to change a few things depending on whether we are making a new post or editing</li>
  <li><strong>Succsess:</strong> Getting the capability to edit a post</li>
  <li><strong>Needs Work:</strong> Restricting access to editing post to only the user that created the post. Getting same capbility to edit comments (I'm having trouble differentiating between the post pk and the comment pk when calling the edit_comment function in a similar way - I may need to dumb it down for the edit.)</li>

</ol>


<p>Alright, we've got some work to do!</p>
