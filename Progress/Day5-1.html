<h1>Day 5: Continuing Styling, getting close to deploy</h1>
<em>May 2, 2018 at 10:47am</em>

<p>I'm feeling good with my accomplishments on this project thus far. I want to take some time now to list out the features I've gotten functional and what I have left to work on.</p>
<h2>Specified Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Complete:<del><em>Users must create an account to add a new message</em></del></li>
  <li>Message Specifications:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete: <del><em>limit message characters to 140</em></del></li>
    <li>If a message contains a url to an image, show the image on the page instead of the URL</li>
    <li>Do not count characters that are part of a URL (for links or images)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Users can edit or delete messages they created</li>
  <li>Users can filter to list messages:
    <ul>
      <li>They have authored</li>
      <li>Other user's messages</li>
      <li>All messages from all users (normal view?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Users can search for a message</li>
  <li>Users can send private messages to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow - looking at it from this perspective I haven't really accomplished all that much from the task list! That's okay, good thing I have a few more days to work on it. I already have a leg up on editing and deleting messages. I think filtering and searching messages should be the next thing I work towards. Then I should figure out adding an app to make PMs possible between users. Here's my new sprint plan:</p>
<h3>
  <p>Breakdown of future work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</li>
    <li>Sprint 7: Allow users to delete & edit posts they have created</li>
    <li>Sprint 8: Load IMTwitter onto Digital Ocean for sharing</li>
    <li>Sprint 9: Create URL recognition in post/comment & load image if image URL is provided</li>
    <li>Sprint 10: Create views to sort posts and comments by author</li>
    <li>Sprint 11: Add search feature</li>
    <li>Sprint 12: Add capabilities of private messaging other users</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<p>Alright, we've got some work to do!</p>
