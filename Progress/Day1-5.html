<h1>Sprint 4: Create interface for making new accounts</h1>
<em>April 28, 2018 at 9:22pm</em>

<p>The tutorial I was using for Sprint 3 by William S. Vincent has a followup tutorial <a href="https://wsvincent.com/django-user-authentication-tutorial-signup/">Django User Signup</a> to make a user account setup app. Apparently Django does not provide views for this, so we will be creating the interface in a new app. It will be interesting to intergrate this with my project!</p>
<p>After completing this sprint, I will go back and work on the post/comments template and model, then pretty things up with HTML formatting and CSS:</p>
<h3><ul>
  <li>Sprint 5: Create the templates and views for posts and comments</li>
  <li>SPrint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</li>
</ul></h3>

<h2>Breakdown of Sprint 4:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>create an app: <code>python manage.py startapp accounts</code></li>
  <li>Add app to the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> in the settings.py file (<em>The author of the tutorial just has 'accounts' added to the list. I would expect that 'accounts.apps.accountsConfig' to be the entry we should add. We'll see if the author's approach works and then I'll try mine if it doesn't.</em>)</li>
  <li>Creat a url entry for accounts. Apparently it needs to go above our auth app.. is this because "Django will look top to bottom for url patterns so when it sees a url route within our accounts app that matches one in the built-in auth app, it will choose the accounts route first." I'll need to find out what "matches" means in this instance (replaces or reroutes?)</li>
  <li>Create a new urls.py inside the accounts directory for signup</li>
  <li>Go into views and create a SignUp class where we use the built in <code>UserCreationForm</code>. We also use a <code>reverse_laze('login')</code> to redirect the user to the login page once they have created an account. (The reverse lazy has an explanation but the rational eludes me at the moment. More to be revealed I suppose.)</li>
  <li>Create a template: 'signup.html' in the project (imtwitter) level templates folder</li>
  <ol type='a'>
    <li>Why the project level and not app level? Still trying to figure this out</li>
    <li>Use the <code>{% extends 'base.html' %}</code> format again.</li>
    <li><strong>Continued point of confusion:</strong>The html looks exactly the same as the 'login.html' with <code> {% csrf_token %}</code> and <code>{{ form.as_p }}</code>. How does Django know what form to use? </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
