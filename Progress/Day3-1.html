<h1>Day 3: Elaborating the Model</h1>
<em>April 30, 2018 at 3:45pm</em>

<p>After spending time yesterday working through part of that project on Lynda, I've decided to move back to my primary project to see if I can work my way through including users in my model. Becuase I'm moving into uncharted teritory for myself, I will be doing more code exploration and less blogging - so my updates might get fewer in between.</p>

<h3>
  <p>Working on Today:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 5: Create the models, templates and views for posts and comments</li>
    <li>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<h2>Sprint 5: Create the models, templates and views for posts and comments</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect posts and comments to user in model with ForeignKey</li>
  <ol>
    <li>To create a ForeignKey for the user in the model I need to put argument <code>on_delete</code> to <code>CASCADE</code> so that (<em>I believe</em>) the post gets deleted when the user gets deleted. I could use another parameter like <code>SET_NULL</code> or <code>SET_DEFAULT</code> to keep the post if the user is deleted, but I think it's fine with cascade. </li>
    <li>I set the default value for the ForeignKey to 1, which should be my superuser</li>
  </ol>
  <em>Wow, that was a lot easier than I expected, now I have to create some templates, URLs and views to diplay the posts and comments in a coherent fasion</em>
  <li></li>
</ol>
